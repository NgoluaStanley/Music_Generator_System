# *MUSIC GENERATOR SYSTEM*
* In this project,we are going to create a music generator model using Tensorflow 2.5.

    ## File Info
    * audio.py -> This file used to generate the music.

    * model_train.py -> This file will train the LSTM model.

    * data_lit.py -> This will process the midi training dataset.

    * midi -> This file contain Piano_notes. midi dataset, that is used in training the model.
    * generate_note.py -> This file is used for note generation.
    * test_audio2.mid -> test

    ## *Skills/Tools/Technologies used:*

        1.Numpy
        2.Tensorflow
        3. Deep learning-LSTM
